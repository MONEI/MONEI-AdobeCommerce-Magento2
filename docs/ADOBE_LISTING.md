## Account & Pricing

**An additional [MONEI](https://monei.com) account is required, and additional fees apply. The account is not created during extension installation. To create an account please visit the [signup page](https://dashboard.monei.com/?action=signUp). For more details please visit the [MONEI pricing page](https://monei.com/pricing/).**

Transaction fees vary based on payment volume with a dynamic pricing model - as your sales volume increases, transaction fees automatically decrease in real-time, allowing you to reinvest more in your business.

## Security & PCI Compliance

We employ the industry's best security practices and tools to maintain bank-level security for merchants and end customers. **MONEI** is PCI DSS Level 1 and GDPR compliant.

For embedded payment methods (cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Bizum), our secure checkout runs as an iFrame modal over your website. The customer enters payment information directly into our secure environment so that your store never comes into contact with the customer's payment data.

For additional payment methods, customers are redirected to the **MONEI** secure hosted payment page. Once the payment process is complete, customers are redirected back to your store.

Tokenization is used to run transactions with stored payment information for returning customers. No confidential card data is ever stored on your Adobe Commerce server. The extension meets European PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements.
