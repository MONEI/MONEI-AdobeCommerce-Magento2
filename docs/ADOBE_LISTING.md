# MONEI Payment Gateway for Adobe Commerce

MONEI brings an all-in-one payment solution to Adobe Commerce that offers a truly unified payment experience across all sales channels. With a single integration, merchants can accept dozens of payment methods including major card networks, digital wallets, and local payment methods through both embedded checkout experiences and hosted payment pagesâ€”helping you maximize conversions and grow your cross-border e-commerce business.

## Account & Pricing

- An account with MONEI is required to process payments.

- Pricing for processing payments is detailed on our [Pricing Page](https://monei.com/pricing/).

## Features

- **Flexible payment integration options**: Choose between embedded mode for a seamless checkout experience directly on your site (supports cards, Bizum, Apple Pay, Google Pay) or MONEI's hosted payment page for broader payment method support and reduced PCI compliance requirements. The embedded payment methods keep customers on your checkout page without redirects, significantly improving conversion rates by reducing cart abandonment.

- **Higher conversion rates with embedded checkout**: Unlike redirected payment methods that take shoppers away from your site, MONEI's embedded payment options keep customers in your checkout flow, dramatically reducing abandonment rates and increasing completed purchases. Customers never leave your site when using cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Bizum in embedded mode.

- **Support for multiple payment methods with one integration**: Accept all major card networks, digital wallets, and local European payment methods including:

  - Card payments (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and more)
  - Digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay, Click to Pay)
  - European payment methods (Bizum, MB WAY, Multibanco)

- **Advanced payment security**: The extension uses industry-leading security practices including tokenization to securely store payment methods for returning customers without sensitive data ever touching your server.

- **Built-in merchant acquiring services**: Skip the hassle of going to a bank for a virtual POS. MONEI provides acquiring services so you can quickly register, activate your account, and start accepting payments.

- **Payments orchestration**: Set payment routing rules to increase successful transactions by up to 95% through payments orchestration. Learn more: [Payments Orchestration Guide](https://monei.com/features/payments-orchestration/)

- **Dynamic pricing model**: As your sales volume increases, transaction fees automatically decrease in real-time, allowing you to reinvest more in your business. Learn more: [MONEI Pricing Details](https://monei.com/pricing/)

- **Real-time sales reporting**: Filter transaction history by day, week, month, or custom time frames to analyze sales performance and identify business opportunities.

- **Fast payment settlements**: Once you're an approved merchant, receive payouts within 24 hours.

- **Streamlined omnichannel payments**: Create a consistent payment experience for customers whether they're shopping online or in physical stores.

- **Tokenization**: The extension uses tokenization to securely store customer payment information for future purchases without sensitive data ever being stored on your Adobe Commerce server.
