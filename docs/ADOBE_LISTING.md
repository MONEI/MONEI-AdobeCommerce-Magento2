**[MONEI](https://monei.com)** is a financial technology company offering a unified payment platform for businesses of all sizes. Founded in 2019, MONEI provides advanced payment processing capabilities with a focus on European markets, helping merchants accept payments across all sales channels through a single integration.

MONEI Payment Module for Adobe Commerce transforms your store's checkout experience by enabling seamless payment processing through a unified platform. This extension eliminates the complexity of managing multiple payment providers by offering multiple payment methods through a single integration, including major cards, digital wallets, PayPal, and local European payment methods. The module intelligently displays payment methods based on MONEI account configuration and the customer's location, ensuring shoppers only see relevant options for their region. It supports flexible payment operations including authorizations with automatic or manual capture, partial captures, and partial refunds, giving merchants complete control over transaction management. It works in two flexible modes: an embedded checkout that keeps customers on your site for higher conversion rates when using cards, Apple Pay or Google Pay; or a hosted payment page for expanded payment method support. Apple Pay is automatically configured and available by default, with no need to manually verify your domain with Apple. Merchants can tailor the checkout flow to specific markets with support for 14 languages, branded payment pages, and configurable email notifications. During checkout, customers select their preferred payment method, complete their purchase either directly on your store or through a quick redirect, and receive immediate confirmation while you benefit from automatic order status updates, fraud protection, and real-time payment analytics. The module significantly reduces cart abandonment, increases international sales through localized payment options, and simplifies reconciliation with unified reporting across all payment channels.

## Account & Pricing

**An additional [MONEI](https://monei.com) account is required, and additional fees apply. The account is not created during extension installation. To create an account please visit the [signup page](https://dashboard.monei.com/?action=signUp). For more details please visit the [MONEI pricing page](https://monei.com/pricing/).**

Transaction fees vary based on payment volume with a dynamic pricing model - as your sales volume increases, transaction fees automatically decrease in real-time, allowing you to reinvest more in your business.

## Security & PCI Compliance

We employ the industry's best security practices and tools to maintain bank-level security for merchants and end customers. **MONEI** is PCI DSS Level 1 and GDPR compliant.

For embedded payment methods (cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Bizum), our secure checkout runs as an iFrame modal over your website. The customer enters payment information directly into our secure environment so that your store never comes into contact with the customer's payment data.

For additional payment methods, customers are redirected to the **MONEI** secure hosted payment page. Once the payment process is complete, customers are redirected back to your store.

Tokenization is used to run transactions with stored payment information for returning customers. No confidential card data is ever stored on your Adobe Commerce server. The extension meets European PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements.
