## Account & Pricing

An additional **[MONEI](https://monei.com)** account is required to process payments, and additional fees apply. The account is not created during extension installation. To create an account, please visit the [MONEI Dashboard Signup page](https://dashboard.monei.com/?action=signUp). Transaction fees vary based on payment volume with a dynamic pricing model - as your sales volume increases, transaction fees automatically decrease in real-time. For more details, please visit the [MONEI Pricing Page](https://monei.com/pricing/).

## Security & PCI Compliance

MONEI employs industry-leading security practices and is PCI DSS Level 1 and GDPR compliant. For embedded payment methods (cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Bizum), the module uses secure iFrames that ensure sensitive payment data is entered directly into MONEI's secure environment without touching your server. For additional payment methods, customers are redirected to MONEI's secure hosted payment page and returned to your store after completing payment.

Tokenization is used to securely store customer payment information for future purchases without sensitive card data ever being stored on your Adobe Commerce server. The extension meets European PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements, and all data handling follows strict privacy standards detailed in the [MONEI Privacy Policy](https://monei.com/privacy-policy/).
