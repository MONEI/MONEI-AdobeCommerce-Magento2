## Code Style
- Follow PSR-12 and bin 2 coding standards (bin2 ruleset)
- Use strict typing with PHP 8.1+ parameter and return type declarations
- Classes: StudlyCaps (e.g., `MoneiApiClient`)
- Methods: camelCase (e.g., `processPayment`)
- Interfaces: StudlyCaps with Interface suffix
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Comprehensive PHPDoc for all classes, methods, and properties
- Use dependency injection, avoid direct object instantiation
- Error handling: Use specialized exception classes and detailed logging

## Project Structure
- `Api`: Service contracts (interfaces)
- `Model`: Business logic and data models
- `Service`: Payment processing and API integration
- `Controller`: HTTP request handlers
- `Block`: View/template data providers
- `view`: Frontend templates and JS components

## Commit Style
- Use conventional commits format: type(scope): message
- Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, chore
- Keep commit messages concise but descriptive
