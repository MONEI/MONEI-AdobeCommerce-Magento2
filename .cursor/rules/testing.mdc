**IMPORTANT** Before writing any test make sure you understand all data structures and constant involved in the test. You need to make sure the methods and constants used in tests exist!

## Test Commands

- Check test coverage with `./bin test/unit-coverage`, it will output coverage directly in the terminal. Do not run this command on every change, only when individual tests are passing
- Run individual tests with `./bin test/unit [path] [args]` for faster feedback
- Run `./bin test --testdox` to run all tests with verbose output
- After test is passing run `./bin analyse` to make sure there are no type errors

## Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage for new features
- 100% coverage for critical payment processing code
- Test all error conditions and exception handling
